## About the Project
**Brinkley's Garden** is a personal or community-driven project dedicated to creating a virtual and physical space where nature, gardening, and education intersect. The project focuses on documenting the growth and beauty of plants, insects, and other garden-related elements, providing educational content, and fostering a love for nature.

Whether you're a gardening enthusiast, a student, or someone curious about the natural world, Brinkley's Garden aims to be a resource and inspiration for everyone interested in exploring and appreciating life in the garden.

# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning
- <b>Define goals</b>
-- Section off the garden into full sun, partial sun, and shade. You also need to note down when these changes occur. My reason is that some plants, although in full sun, only need 4-6 hours of sunlight; any more can harm the plant. Other plants want as much sun as they can get. Note: When plants enjoy basking in the sun, you need to check the moisture in the soil using a moisture and pH meter.
- <b>Gather resources</b>
-- Decide on the best planters you will be using; size, shape, and type of container matter. Why does it matter? First, consider the depth of the container for plants with a long, deep root system or those that love to spread along the whole yard. These two types of plants, usually trees, can take over your ground nutrition and deplete water sources meant for other plants. LOL. Play nice, so everyone will win-win.
  Do make important decisions regarding how much land will be involved and the root system in directing planting into the ground. If you are using containers, you have to make sure it is the appropriate size and depth. NOTE: Always use black containers; research shows you plants will thrive better and longer. 
-- Next, look for available water sources and how you will disperse the water to the vegetation.
