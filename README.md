# Brinkley_s_Garden
**Brinkley's Garden** A peaceful haven where smiles blossom alongside the vibrant, flourishing garden, as cheerful animals and busy insects dance and play among the blooms, creating a symphony of life and joy.

## About the Project
**Brinkley's Garden** is a personal or community-driven project dedicated to creating a virtual and physical space where nature, gardening, and education intersect. The project focuses on documenting the growth and beauty of plants, insects, and other garden-related elements, providing educational content, and fostering a love for nature.

Whether you're a gardening enthusiast, a student, or someone curious about the natural world, Brinkley's Garden aims to be a resource and inspiration for everyone interested in exploring and appreciating life in the garden.

# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning
- <b>Define goals</b>
-- Section off the garden into full sun, partial sun, and shade. You also need to note down when these changes occur. My reason is that some plants, although in full sun, only need 4-6 hours of sunlight; any more can harm the plant. Other plants want as much sun as they can get. Now  inspect the partial and shade areas. Sometimes these areas change when seasons change. Always check so your plants so they can benefit from the sunlight or shade. Note: When plants enjoy basking in the sun, you need to check the moisture in the soil using a moisture and pH meter. Try not to over water the ones in the shade.</P>
- <b>Gather resources</b>
-- Decide on the best planters you will be using; size, shape, and type of container matter. Why does it matter? First, consider the depth of the container for plants with a long deep root system or those that love to spread along the whole yard. These two types of plants, usually trees, can take over your ground nutrition and deplete water sources meant for other plants. LOL. Play nice, so everyone will win-win.
  <p>Do make important decisions regarding how much land will be involved and the root system if you plan to planting directing into the ground. If you are using containers, please be sure it is the appropriate size and depth. <p><b>NOTE on Containers;</b>: Research shows that plants will thrive better and last longer when using black containers. Black absorbs more sunlight, converting it into heat, which causes the soil inside to warm up quickly. Some plants benefit from this heat, especially in cooler climates. However, in hot or sunny conditions, this can lead to the soil drying out faster and temperatures rising to levels that may stress or damage your plant roots.</p>
  <p>In contrast, lighter-colored containers reflect more sunlight, which keeps the soil cooler. Cooler soil helps prevent overheating, keeps moisture longer, and creates a healthier environment for your plants. Especially during hot and sunny days. It might be smarter to pick lighter-colored containers—like white, beige, or pastels—to protect your plants if you live in hot desert areas. However, desert nights tend to drop temperature. 
    To ensure healthy, thriving plants that produce abundantly, it’s important to understand and meet their specific sunlight, water, and root growth needs.</P>
- <b>Water Management</b>
-- Next, look for available water sources and how you will disperse the water to the vegetation. Test your water especially if you are using well water, or from openwater areas on your land.
